Death from the Womb: Uncovering links between Maternal, Malnutrtion, and Neonatal Deaths

This reports investigates the relationship of general malnutrition and specifically protein-energy deficient malnutrition death rates to maternal death rates, as well as the relationship of maternal death reates to neonatal death rates. This is done by analyzing correlations between the variables and fitting linear models to understand how they affect one another. Our analysis is limited to the year 2016. It is generally global, but we do take a more in-depth look at Sub-Saharan Africa, as the top four sub-regions with the highest maternal mortality rates were all in that greater region. From our analysis, we learned that neonatal mortaility and nutritional deficiency death rates both seem positively correlated with maternal mortality, a conclusion in line with previous findings.
